## About
Closetspace is a wardrobe management app designed to help users build and maintain an intentional wardrobe that enhances their personal style. Users can upload images of their clothing items and view their entire wardrobe in a modern UI. The app analyzes the user's wardrobe content using machine learning to offer personalized recommendations to complement the user's style. By leveraging modern neural nets, Closetspace can pick up on nuances in a user's fashion choices while avoiding the need to collect tons of user data, which traditional recommender systems using collaborative filtering techniques fail to achieve in the fashion context.
